She was once an orphan, wandering the world with her sister from a young age. Later, the then-High Preceptor of Yunkui Summit took them in, and they became disciples, learning the craft of Yunkui Summit. During this time, Yixuan demonstrated exceptional talent. No matter the technique, she would quickly master it, not only understanding it thoroughly but also creating her own unique techniques. The Qingming Bird was one of the special techniques she and her sister developed together, which helped her eliminate enemies and banish evil spirits in various difficult and dangerous situations.\n\nAfter becoming the sect's High Preceptor, she accepted an invitation from Mayor Mayflower and joined the Hollow Investigative Association as a partnered special investigator. After becoming High Preceptor, Yixuan took in many talented disciples to continue Yunkui Summit's lineage. However, her approach is rather casual, and often, even when teaching by example, her disciples can only guess her intentions... Yet, Yixuan isn't troubled by this, as she believes there's no standard answer to the so-called \"right path.\" What matters to her is that her disciples find their own \"right path.\" Of course, if they can understand and learn on their own, that's even better. As their Shifu, she simply lets things unfold naturally.",
