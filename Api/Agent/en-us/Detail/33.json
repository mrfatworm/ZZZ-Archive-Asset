The other members of the squad were all killed during the fall of the old capital. Her eyes were also corrupted during this disaster. Trigger is currently working alongside the other members of her new squad to investigate the truth behind the fall of the old capital. Trigger has a deep sense of loyalty to her companions, willing to go to great lengths for them. Master, from her actions, it is evident that she considers you a companion and has a noticeably high level of affection for you. It is likely that some event has occurred, which has left a strong, positive impression on her. Suggestion: Offering unlimited red bean buns and round-the-clock access to soundproof rooms for harmonica playing as conditions, try negotiating a long-term partnership. This would enable you to secure extremely dependable combat strength with minimal expenditure.",
