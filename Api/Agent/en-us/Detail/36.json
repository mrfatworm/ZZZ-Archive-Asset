He's proficient in martial arts, and an expert in pressure-point techniques. As the one managing Suibian Temple's money, he's a master at keeping costs down and can bargain a 5,000 Denny piece of meat down to 500. If he can make something at home, he refuses to purchase it at a store, and no matter which big supermarket or shop you name, he's got a coupon for it tucked in his pocket. Thanks to him, the members of Suibian Temple enjoy delicious yet budget-friendly meals every day. As the head of the kitchen, he demands precise flavor profiles and pays keen attention to his friends' opinions. What's more, given his years of frugality, it's safe to assume that both the group's treasury and his secret piggy bank have ballooned to jaw-dropping levels.",
