Only when the moon begins to sigh does the flower bud dare to bloom, releasing a joyous bird. It weaves through the stars, gathering glimmers of starlight, and before dawn breaks, it lands beneath your eaves... shaking off a night full of whispered love.\n\n\"Lord Phaethon needs only Vivian. Lord Phaethon loves only Vivian. Lord Phaethon sees only Vivian... Chant that to it for 178 days, and you can give it to Lord Phaethon.\" — Vivian, fortune telling and voodoo are not scientific and offer no real value. Do not attempt them lightly",
