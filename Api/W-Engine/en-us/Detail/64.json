First, you explore the meridians, which is like rinsing the ingredients; then, you warm your palms, akin to heating the pan; and with two fingers pressing on the laughter point, the sound of laughter is like stir-frying. Practitioners must never recklessly strike a person's fatal point — it's like pouring hot oil into a stove, causing a disaster.\n\n\"This little ball is darting between the acupoints, just like the fish balls I fling when making stir-fried noodles on the hot iron plate.\" —Pan Yinhu, distracted by random thoughts while doing acupoint memory training with a wooden panda sculpture.",
