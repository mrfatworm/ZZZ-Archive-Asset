When this effect is triggered, if the equipper is not the active character, they gain 1 stack of Spirit Lock, up to a maximum of 3 stacks. This can trigger only once per use of a skill. Each stack of Spirit Lock increases the equipper's Impact by 4％/4.6%/5.2%/5.8%/6.4%, lasting 12s. The duration of each stack is calculated separately. At full stacks of Spirit Lock, the equipper's Impact increases by an additional 8％/9.2%/10.4%/11.6%/12.8%",
